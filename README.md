## 📜 Server moderation guide: The Basics
Welcome to the moderation team! This document outlines our core principles, rules, and procedures to ensure we're all on the same page and can moderate effectively and fairly.

### 🎯 Moderator's Responsibilities & Rules
Your primary role as a moderator is to foster a safe, welcoming, and engaging environment for our community. You are not just enforcers, but also role models.

1. Be Proactive & Active: Don't just wait for reports. Keep an eye on conversations and engage with the community for at least 15–30 minutes per day.
  
2. Be Fair & Consistent: Apply the rules the same way to everyone.
  
3. Be Calm & Professional: Dont argue with members. Take difficult conversations to DMs or private threads.
  
4. Lead by Example: Your behavior sets the standard for the entire server.

5. Punish Correctly: Follow server rules and the moderation handbook strictly when issuing warnings, bans, mutes, etc.

6. Respond to Mod Pings: Make an effort to respond promptly when tagged.

7. Respect the Team: Follow directions from higher ranks, and treat lower ranks with respect. We work as a team — disagreements should be handled calmly and constructively.

8. No Abuse of Power: Do not assign yourself roles/levels you have not earned.

9. Tidy Punishment Logs: Keep reasons clear, professional, and free of slurs or irrelevant content. Untidy logs can result in demotion.

10. Staff-chat: Staff Discussions Stay in staff-chat. Keep internal matters private and professional.

11. Limit Role Pings: Do not ping non-personal roles. (Exception: chat revive)

12. No Stat Padding: Do not spam punishments to boost ModStats. This will lead to demotion.

13. Equal Accountability: Staff breaking rules will be treated like any regular member and punished accordingly.

14. No Bribes: Accepting bribes for staff privileges or actions is strictly prohibited — even if we’re understaffed.

### ⚖️ The rule hierarchy (Enforcement Steps)
We use an escalation system to be fair and give members a chance to correct their behavior. The severity of the action can skip steps for serious offenses.

* Standard Process: Verbal Warning (Public or DM): A friendly, but clear, reminder of the rules. Use this for minor, first-time offenses.
Example DM: "Hey! Just a quick heads-up, please keep the chat in #general on-topic. Thanks!"

* Formal Warning (Logged): An official warning logged in a private mod channel. Clearly state which rule was broken, use dyno.

* Temporary Mute/Timeout: Give timeouts depending on what says later in the doc.

* Kick: Removing the member from the server. They can rejoin with an invite. Use this for persistent rule-breaking after warnings, or for medium-level offenses.

* Ban: Permanently removing the member from the server. They cannot rejoin. This is for the most severe violations.

Humor is subjective, and it can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a joke and hateful/harmful conduct. When reviewing situations, always consider context — but also remember that intent does not erase impact.

All punishments listed below assume the member has clearly and fully violated the rule. If the situation is borderline or unclear, use your judgment and consult with other staff before issuing a punishment.
