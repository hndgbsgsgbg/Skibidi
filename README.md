📜 Server Moderation Guide: The Basics
Welcome to the moderation team! This document outlines our core principles, rules, and procedures to ensure we're all on the same page and can moderate effectively and fairly.
1. 🎯 The Moderator's Role
Your primary role is to foster a safe, welcoming, and engaging environment for our community. You are not just enforcers, but also leaders and role models.
Be Proactive: Don't just wait for reports. Keep an eye on conversations.
Be Fair & Consistent: Apply the rules the same way to everyone.
Be Calm & Professional: Never argue with members. Take difficult conversations to DMs or private threads.
Lead by Example: Your behavior sets the standard for the entire server.
2. ⚖️ The Rule Hierarchy (Enforcement Steps)
We use an escalation system to be fair and give members a chance to correct their behavior. The severity of the action can skip steps for serious offenses (see Section 3).
Standard Process:
Verbal Warning (Public or DM): A friendly, but clear, reminder of the rules. Use this for minor, first-time offenses.
Example DM: "Hey! Just a quick heads-up, please keep the chat in #general on-topic. Thanks!"

Formal Warning (Logged): An official warning logged in a private mod channel. Clearly state which rule was broken, use dyno.

Temporary Mute/Timeout: Give timeouts depending on what says later in the doc.

Kick: Removing the member from the server. They can rejoin with an invite. Use this for persistent rule-breaking after warnings, or for medium-level offenses.

Ban: Permanently removing the member from the server. They cannot rejoin. This is for the most severe violations.
